### 1. Summarization on what I have gained.
#### I think this industrial talk from Clarity Techworks really open my eyes on how the computer science industry works in real life situation. The talk highlighted the nature of ICT careers, emphasizing the essential of adaptability and staying in touch with the evolving technologies. The speakers also stressed the importance of a holistic approach to ICT careers, merging theoretical knowledge with practical skills. They also mentioned that for further success in this industry requires ongoing learning, practical experience and productive networking.
### 2. Suggestion from me.
#### For this Industrial Talk session, I suggest that it will be done in physical platform so the students can have direct conversation with the industry.
### 3. Others.
#### I think it will be good to have a Telegram group after the session so in the further time, students can ask more questions to the industry and they can share their answers to the students.
