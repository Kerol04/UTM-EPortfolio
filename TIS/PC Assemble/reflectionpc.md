# Reflection
### 1. Summarization on what I have gained.
#### Overall, this PC Assemble session was the best session in this course for me since I like doing physical or practical tasks. Although this was my first experience of assembling PC, it was easier for my group to finish the task because we were helped by the lab assistants and the lecturer. They were friendly and very helpful. I learned the components of PC and I also realized how important it is to follow the steps one by one when assembling the PC, or else it won't work well. It was such a great experience.
### 2. Suggestion from me.
#### For this PC Assemble session, I suggest for it to contain more tasks because the recent session is too short and easy.
### 3. Others
#### I think it will be a great idea if we have another PC Assemble session which uses another model or new version of PC.
