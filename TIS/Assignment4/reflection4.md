# Reflection
### 1. Summarization on what I have gained.
#### I think this industrial talk from Dr Seah Choon Sen about I-Farm really impressed me and showed me how the computer science technology can be implemented to facilitate humans' life. I gain knowledge on how to correctly plan out a process from the beginning to the end, starting with the problem statements and finishing with specific information like the structure of the costs. This is an appropriate method to complete a job, so no details are left out that can cause any issues. I also recognized the I-Farm intiative as a commendable effort addressing real-world challenges in agriculture by efficiently integrating technology.
### 2. Suggestion from me.
#### For this Industrial Talk session, I suggest that it will be done in physical platform so the students can have direct conversation with the industry. Plus, this session started a bit late from the actual time because some problems occured. This showed that online session had deficiency in term of time.
### 3. Others.
#### Just to add, I amazed with the innovation invented by them. One notable achievement is their success in minimizing food-wastage through a demand-driven approach, ensuring production aligns with the market needs, at once helping to reduce environmental pollution.
