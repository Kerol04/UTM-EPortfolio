# Reflection
### 1. Summarization on what I have gained.
#### This industrial visit to UTM Digital really change my perspective on computer science industry. I have a clear picture of a company that focuses heavily on computer science thanks to this industry visit. I gain more knowledge about the company's environment as well as the apps and technologies that are utilised. The visit also make me realized how the role of UTM Digital is essential for all UTM individuals. It was such a great visit especially when I entered the data centre.
### 2. Suggestion from me.
#### For this Industrial Visit session, I suggest that it will be done in a more suitable time. For example, the data centre has a regular security check up which is 4 times a day, I really want to see how the check up goes on. So I think it will be better for the session to be held while the check up is ongoing.
### 3. Others
#### Maybe if we can have more visit to the others company will be a great idea so the students can gain more information.
