# Reflection
### 1. Summarization on what I have gained.
#### I think this industrial talk from Ms. Qistina had give me an opportunity to know more about system development particularly in Credence. I get to know the history, the technology and tools used in Credence's system development. I also recognized the significance of improving soft skills through active participation in workshops and networking. After the session, I realized the dual focus on technical expertise and interpersonal abilities will guide my growth in the field of system development.
### 2. Suggestion from me.
#### For this Industrial Talk session, I suggest that it will be done in physical platform so the students can have direct conversation with the industry. Although Ms. Qistina had cooperate well to answer all the questions from the students, I think it will be better for this session to be done in a physical manner because some questions need to be discuss properly.
### 3. Others.
#### In addition, this industrial talk session had motivate me to look forward to catch up and contribute to this exciting upcoming journey to become a successful individual in the computer science field.
