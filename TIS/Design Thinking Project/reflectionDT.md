# Reflection
### 1. Summarization on what I have gained.
#### I think the Design Thinking Project is the most highlighted task in this Technology and Information System course. I learned that to finish a job or a project properly, we will need to go through each phase orderly from the beginning until the end. Engaging in this project also enhanced my problem solving skills. It tought me how to overcome issues creatively and understand user needs. I also found out that teamwork is important when doing a project as a group.
### 2. Suggestion from me.
#### For this Design Thinking Project task, I suggest that the lecturers or the coordinator provide us with some example from the past years as a referance so the students can have a better explanation on what they are doing.
### 3. Others.
#### I really hope that the instructions given is a little more understandable. I was confused about the structure of the design thinking project at first.
